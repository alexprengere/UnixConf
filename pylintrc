[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
# either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time.
#enable=

# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
# multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
# it should appear only once).
# Disabled messages:
# W0613: Unused argument %r Used when a function or method argument is not used.
# W0622: Redefining built-in %r Used when a variable or function override a built-in.
# W0232: Class has no __init__ method Used when a class has no __init__ method, neither 
#        its parent classes.
# W0142: Used * or * magic* Used when a function or method is called using *args or **kwargs
#        to dispatch arguments. This doesn't improve readility and should be used with care.
# W0102: Dangerous default value %s as argument Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary 
#        is detected in a default value for an argument.
# W0212: Access to a protected member %s of a client class Used when a protected member 
#        (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an underscore) is access outside the class 
#        or a descendant of the class where it's defined.
# R0201: Method could be a function. Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so 
#        could be written as a function.
# R0801: Similar lines in %s files. Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected 
#        among multiple file. This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
#        duplication.
# C0302: Too many lines in module (%s) Used when a module has too much lines, reducing 
#        its readibility.
# W0602: Using global for %r but no assigment is done Used when a variable is defined through 
#        the "global" statement but no assigment to this variable is done.
# W0603: Using the global statement Used when you use the "global" statement to update 
#        a global variable. PyLint just try to discourage this usage. That doesn't mean 
#        you can not use it !
# W0704: Except doesn't do anything Used when an except clause does nothing but "pass" 
#        and there is no "else" clause.
# I0011: Locally disabling %s Used when an inline option disable a message or a messages category.
# E0611: Error when import module, problem of false positives.
